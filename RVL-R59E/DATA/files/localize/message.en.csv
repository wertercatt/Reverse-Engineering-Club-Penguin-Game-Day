1428,"Well, well, if it isn't little goodie BLUE shoes! You"
,"better watch OUT, cause Team Red's watching YOU!"
1429,"{{K714}}"
1430,"Right ON! We got another zone! Let's head to the"
,"Dock and find out the plan!"
1431,"{{K711}}"
1432,"Did you hear? Terrible news! While we were busy,"
,"Team Green took our home base at the Dock!"
1433,"{{K711}}"
1434,"You already took the Dock back from Team Green?"
,"Wow, you work fast! Our next target is the Ski"
,"Village!"
1435,"{{K712}}"
1436,"Team Green! I just KNEW there was something funny"
,"about them. And I'm not just talking about their silly"
,"propeller hats! "
1437,"{{K712}}"
1438,"Wow, thanks for winning the Dock back for us!"
1439,"{{K786}}"
1440,"Team Blue! I thought you'd show up. Want to take"
,"the Dock back from Team Green? You'll have to play"
,"the Game Series."
1441,"No Problem! Let me at 'em!"
1442,"Tell me more!"
1443,"Not now. Maybe I'll come back later."
1444,"{{K786}}"
1445,"Good luck to you. GO TEAMS!"
1446,"{{K720}}"
1447,"I like this conquering business. Wish it was a full time"
,"job! We're gonna try to take over some more of the"
,"island!"
1448,"{{K721}}"
1449,"We're gonna make this our new home base, now that"
,"we've gotten rid of all those old blue signs and stuff."
1450,"{{K722}}"
1451,"Hey, Team Blue. Don't try to hide it. You totally"
,"WANT a propeller hat, don't you?"
1452,"{{K717}}"
1453,"YES! We got our game back on and took the Dock"
,"back! Phew. "
1454,"{{K716}}"
1455,"I can't believe Team Green conquered the Dock. We "
,"have to remember that they might be funny... But"
,"they're tough, too!"
1456,"{{K716}}"
1457,"Hey, way to go! You're the one who won back our"
,"home base."
1458,"{{K704}}"
1459,"The Ski Village - including the cool cuckoo clock in"
,"the Ski Lodge - is gonna belong to Team Red!"
1460,"{{K710}}"
1461,"We need FOCUS if we want"
,"to win the Ski Village. "
1462,"{{K720}}"
1463,"It's time for Team Green to step up! We'll be singing"
,"some kinda weepy blue song if we lose.... Get it?"
,"Blue? Hahaha."
1464,"{{K730}}"
1465,"I think that the Ski Village really should belong to"
,"Team Yellow, don't you? Oh... you don't?"
1466,"{{K786}}"
1467,"You're with Team Blue! Want to play the Ski Village"
,"Game Series and try to take it over?"
1468,"Yes! I've practiced hard and I'm ready to go!"
1469,"Tell me more!"
1470,"Not now, thanks."
1471,"{{K786}}"
1472,"Awesome! May the best team win. Good luck!"
1473,"{{K710}}"
1474,"Nice job at the Ski Village, {{T}}. "
,"Let's head to the Dock for now. BLUE! BLUE! BLUE!"
1475,"{{K710}}"
1476,"Harsh that we lost the Dock. I don't like to lose. But"
,"I'll admit Team Green's a RIOT."
1477,"{{K710}}"
1478,"AMAZING! You got the Dock back for us! Now let's"
,"see about the Snow Forts."
1479,"{{K720}}"
1480,"I know you're just GREEN with envy that we took"
,"your home base. Don't worry - you fit right in with"
,"the new green decor!"
1481,"{{K786}}"
1482,"Get at least 3rd place overall!"
1483,"{{K786}}"
1484,"Get at least 2nd place overall!"
1485,"{{K786}}"
1486,"Beat Team Green in three games! Don't worry"
,"about the other teams. Just don't lose to Team"
,"Green!"
1487,"{{K786}}"
1488,"Wanna try another snowball fight? If you win, you"
,"conquer the zone!"
1489,"Yeah! "
1490,"Do you have any hints?"
1491,"No, thanks. "
1492,"{{K786}}"
1493,"You can do it, {{T}}!"
1494,"{{K786}}"
1495,"Wanna try hitting the targets again? It's all you have"
,"left to do to conquer the zone!"
1496,"Yeah!"
1497,"Do you have any hints?"
1498,"No, thanks. "
1499,"{{K786}}"
1500,"It's show time, {{T}}!"
1501,"{{K786}}"
1502,"Wanna try again to paint a sign? It's all you have"

1503,"Yeah!"
1504,"Do you have any hints?"
1505,"No, thanks."
1506,"{{K786}}"
1507,"Win this and you'll get your home base back,"
,"{{T}}!"
1508,"{{K786}}"
1509,"Don't stand in one place! Move around so it's hard"
,"for the other team to hit you!"
1510,"{{K786}}"
1511,"It's all about timing! "
1512,"{{K786}}"
1513,"When someone from the other team's ready to"
,"throw a paintball, hit 'em with one of your own!"
1514,"{{K711}}"
1515,"We're so close to victory! Blue all the way!"
1516,"{{K712}}"
1517,"{{T}}! Awesome work! I sense a"
,"Team Blue cheer and dance somewhere in the future."
1518,"{{K717}}"
1519,"Don't worry, the Dock's defense is taken care of. Go"
,"capture the final zone! I can just hear it... {{W}}They"
,"shoot... they SCORE THE ZONE!{{W}}"
1520,"{{K716}}"
1521,"There's only one zone left, and that's the Ski Hill."
,"Let's give it all we've got and win this thing for Team"
,"Blue!"
1522,"{{K710}}"
1523,"If anyone can win the Ski Hill for us, it's you, "
,"{{T}}. I'm COUNTING on you!"
1524,"{{K786}}"
1525,"You're really close to winning Game Day. Are you"
,"ready to try the Game Series for the final zone?"
1526,"Yes! I can't wait."
1527,"Tell me more!"
1528,"Maybe I'll come back later."
1529,"{{K786}}"
1530,"GO TEAMS! Good luck."
1531,"{{K700}}"
1532,"Not gonna lose to Team Blue. Not gonna lose to Team"
,"Blue. Not gonna.... Shhhhh. I'm trying to concentrate!"
1533,"{{K714}}"
1534,"We just need this zone, and then Game Day's is all"
,"ours. "
1535,"{{K724}}"
1536,"You must be really tired. You should rest for a while."
,"Like... just long enough for Team Green to conquer"
,"the Ski Hill! HAHAHA!"
1537,"{{K734}}"
1538,"Team Yellow really wants to own the Ski Hill. Did"
,"you see the Cloudmaker 3000 here during the"
,"Festival of Flight?"
1539,"{{K786}}"
1540,"If you want to expand your team's territory, try"
,"expanding this balloon!"
1541,"{{K786}}"
1542,"If you blow it big enough without bursting it, you'll"
,"have the Ski Hill! TWEET! "
1543,"{{K786}}"
1544,"You have to get 1st place overall!"
1545,"{{K786}}"
1546,"Wanna try inflating a giant balloon again? If you can"
,"do it, the zone's yours."
1547,"Yeah! "
1548,"Do you have any hints?"
1549,"No, thanks. "
1550,"{{K786}}"
1551,"You're almost there, {{T}}!"
1552,"{{K786}}"
1553,"Start out faster to get the balloon nice and big. But"
,"then slow down so it doesn't pop!"
1554,"{{K711}}"
1555,"We did it, {{T}}! Fair and square,"
,"Team Blue rocked out Game Day. Team Blue"
,"forever!!"
1556,"{{K704}}"
1557,"I didn't know Team Blue had someone as tough as"
,"you! Wish you would have signed up with Team Red!"
1558,"{{K712}}"
1559,"I think after Game Day's done, penguins should be"
,"going into the Night Club and turning the lights all"
,"BLUE!!"
1560,"{{K720}}"
1561,"Wow, I guess blue is a really tough color! That's"
,"probably why Shadow Guy wears blue..."
1562,"{{K717}}"
1563,"Team Blue all the way!"
1564,"{{K713}}"
1565,"Our power's teamwork! And patience and practice,"
,"too. Whoa. I sound like Sensei. I wonder if he'd be on"
,"Team Blue?"
1566,"{{K715}}"
1567,"Give me a B! L! U! E! What do we have? (whispers "
,"softly) Uh... can you help me out? I like snowballs."
,"Not spelling."
1568,"{{K716}}"
1569,"I wish Rockhopper could see us now! Rockhopper's"
,"red. But he'd totally cheer for BLUE! Yes! "
1570,"{{K730}}"
1571,"The island looks good in blue. It's a nice color. A lot"
,"like yellow, really, except that it's... y'know... MUCH"
,"bluer."
1572,"{{K710}}"
1573,"We did it! We WON Game Day! I've never felt so"
,"proud to wear this jersey before."
1574,"{{K724}}"
1575,"Congra-BLUE-lations on winning Game Day! You"
,"played blue-tifully today. You were abso-blue-tely"
,"incredi-blue."
1576,"{{K734}}"
1577,"I like Game Day. And congrats on the big win! But it'll"
,"be nice to be able to get back in the Dojo. "
1578,"{{K700}}"
1579,"You won for now but we'll get you next time! And"
,"the time after next time! And then it'll be your turn"
,"to win again."

3074,"Yes! Team Yellow wants the Snow Forts!"
3075,"Tell me more!"
3076,"No, thanks. Maybe I'll come back later."
3077,"{{K786}}"

3114,"{{K734}}"
3115,"We should go after the Snow Forts next. Redecorate"

3150,"{{K731}}"
3151,"One zone to go! I'm nervous. Like it's opening night"

3153,"Phew... I've been prance-dancing so much today that"

3154,"{{K733}}"

3190,"{{K731}}"
3191,"Really? For reals? For true? Team Red stormed the"
,"Beach and captured our home base! Argh! NOT"
,"good. How very un-yellow!"
3192,"{{K736}}"
3193,"I knew Team Red was mad when we took the Snow"

,"you don't mind that we redecorated a little!"
3202,"{{K704}}"
3203,"The Beach? It's RED. If the Lighthouse was open"

3204,"{{K701}}"
3205,"See what you get for taking the Snow Forts from"
